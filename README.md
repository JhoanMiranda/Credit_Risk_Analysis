# Credit_Risk_Analysis


This analysis was made to predict if a customer is most likely to default on payments using a machine learning model 
Process


Using Jupyter Notebook we load the information and then we proceed to clean it and transform the data that will be use to analyze from letters to numbers in order to do our calculations, then due the difference on the data we had to perform the SMOTEENN process to fix the imbalance on the data that way we was able to give a more accurate result.


## Conclusion

After the analysis was made, we got the following results. 

### •	Random Over Sampler
